1) The submachien for the VolumeSensor.fm was tested by itself with messages
using the WhiteBaord Moniotr like 
msg type (valueVolDetector)? 
      int --> 0
 content? 5
 data type (Int)? 

ONE EXTERNAL: valueVolDetector

2) The submachine PumpStarter tested in issolation

Two externals
buttonHeldPressed
dossageInterrupted

3) The master machine is PumpMasterController
Tested individually with
extern batteriesConnected; extern timeLeft;
extern volumeNormal; extern  timeLeft;
extern normalCharge;  extern volumeEmpty; extern  ssbuttonHeldPressed;
extern airOnLine; extern blockageInLine; 


But beleive the only extern should be
extern airOnLine; extern blockageInLine; 
 extern  ssbuttonHeldPressed;

batteriesConnected and normalCharge  should come from the Batteries machine
volumeBormal and VolumeEmpty should come from VolumeSensor

4) A concurrent machine is DosageBeeper tested individually

-beeperStartSignal comes from the PumpMasterCOntroller turn on
ion Entry to Running, turn off on entry to Pump With Power
-fireTimeBeeper comes also from PumpMasterControoler, turn on on Entry
to Dossage COmplete, turn off on entry to pump with power

- batteriesConencted comes from BatteriesMaster.fsm
- normalCharge comes from BatteriesSensor.fsm

-aborted comes from PumpStarter state aborted who turn it on
- times is an internal variable to count 3 times


5) BatteriesMaster has the first

OVERALL EXTERNAL VARIABLE batteriesInPlace
produces the shared variable batteriesConnected

Tested individually

6) BatteriesSensor is sub-machine of Batteries Master
OVERALL EXTERNAL VARIABLE batteriesSensorLow
produces the shared variable normalCharge


7) But machiens for the Batteries tested and theu work with the two overall
external variables
OVERALL EXTERNAL VARIABLE batteriesInPlace
OVERALL EXTERNAL VARIABLE batteriesSensorLow

8) Now we test 3 machines, the two for the batteries and the DossageBeeper
batteriesConencted and normalCharge are no longer external
These 3 machiens work
