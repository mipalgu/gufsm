     * The FileParser parses a dispatch table provided in the constructor into a Schedule object. The dispatch table is broken up into a requirements
     * section and a Schedule section. The sections are separated by a blank line. The top section is the requirements section and designates the
     * machines to be scheduled and their required periods and deadlines. The scheduling section indicates the entire cycle of when the
     * machines are scheduled. This consists of the machine index based on the list of machines provided in the requirements section
     * starting at 0 and the scheduled time after schedule start. All times including periods, start times and deadlines are represented
     * in microseconds. The schedule will repeat indefinitely. The dispatch table is to be formatted using the following style:
     *
     * PATH_TO_MACHINE0\tPERIOD\tDEADLINE
     * PATH_TO_MACHINE1\tPERIOD\tDEADLINE
     * ...\n\n
